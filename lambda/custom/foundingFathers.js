	HAMILTON: "Congratulations, you're Alexander Hamilton! \
				You never did become the President of the United States, but you did have a hit broadway musical written about you, which is about as good. You did a number of amazing things. You were George Washington's most trusted aid. You wrote most of the Federalist papers, which ensured the ratification of the U.S. Constitution. And as the first Treasury Secretary, you were so successful that a group of merchants paid for a fifteen-foot marble statue of you that stood on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange until it was destroyed by the Great Fire of 1835.",
	FRANKLIN: "Congratulations, you're Benjamin Franklin!\
				By the time the United States was formed, you were too old to even consider being president, but you still lived a storied life. You invented all manner of things, you created the first political cartoon, and you popularized a number of phrases including 'time is money', 'a penny saved is a penny earned', and 'three may keep a secret, if two of them are dead.' It is quite likely you will be remembered for centuries to come, but as you said, 'in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.'",
	WASHINGTON: "Congratulations, you're George Washington! \
				You were the first President of the United States. But that's not all. You were a venerated war hero, commanding the Continental Army for 8 years, and you even refused any payment. You invented the term 'so help me God' when you used it in your first inauguration, and you also came up with the idea of being called 'Mr. President' as your official manner of address. You certainly weren't perfect, but without you, the United States would not exist in anything even resembling its current form."
