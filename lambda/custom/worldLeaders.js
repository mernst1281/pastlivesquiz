	MERKEL : "Congratulations, you're German Chancellor Angela Merkel! \
			  You've been the chancellor for more than ten years. In the last few years you've even been called the leader of the free world, although you've been having a hard time just forming a government of late. Your father was a Luthern Minister and after getting your Ph.D in Physical Chemistry, you ran for office. You're terrified of dogs, but don't worry. Everyone needs at least one flaw to make them relatable.",
	ELIZABETH : "Congratulations, you're Queen Elizabeth the First.\
				You ruled England from 1558 to 1603. Your father was King Henry the Eighth, and fun fact, he had your mother executed. You never married, and that is why you were nicknamed the Virgin Queen. In fact, the U.S. state of Virginia is named after you. You were only the ruler of England—not Scotland or any of Ireland—but, even so, holding onto power for more than forty years is quite the accomplishment.",
	HATSEPSHUT : "Congratulations, you're Hatsepshut, fifth pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt!\
				  You came to the throne in 1478 BCE and are considered one of the most successful pharaohs, reigning longer than any other Egyptian woman. You built the tallest obelisks in the world, and one of them still stands today: nearly 3,500 years after you built it. Your name might not be a household name, but don't worry: your building projects were so prolific that there's a room of the Metropolitan Museum of Art entirely devoted to statuary from your buildings."
