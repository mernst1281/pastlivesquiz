	CENTAUR: "Congratulations, you're a centaur! \
			  That is, you're a creature with the upper body of a human and the lower body and legs of a horse. You feature prominently in Greek and Roman mythology and were said to have lived on the island of Cyprus. You've been portrayed both as being the embodiment of untamed nature, as well as the wisest and noblest of creatures. You were featured both in C.S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia as well as in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. Not too shabby",
	UNICORN: "Congratulations, you're a unicorn! \
			 You're basically just a horse with a horn growing out of its forehead, but notwithstanding this fact, people seem to love you. You're referenced in the ancient seals of the Indus Valley Civilization, by the ancient Greeks, and even in some translations of the Bible. You're often used as the symbol of purity and grace, and your horn is said to have the power of healing sickness. Some people think you may have existed although there's no evidence of that. Less fun theories of your origins include that you're based on: the rhinoceros, the single-horned goat, or even the narwal",
	CERBERUS: "Congratulations, you're Cerberus! \
			  That is, you're the three-headed dog in Greek mythology that guards the underworld, sometimes also called the hound of Hades. Your job is basically to look terrifying and make sure none of the dead escape the underworld. Unfortunately, you're primarily known for your failure when you were captured by Heracles as one of Heracles' twelve labors. But don't worry, you're still very scary and super cool-looking"
